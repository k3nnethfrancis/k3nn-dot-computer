            <h1>world model</h1>
<p>I put together this document as an attempt to capture my world model. It is in no way exhaustive. I update it as I update my model of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no defined paths, only routes taken by many and others less traveled.</li>
<li>Kindness is an important virtue but is easily confused for weakness. Use that to your advantage.</li>
<li>Money is a number in a database. Use it as leverage, not a limitation.</li>
<li>Love makes life worth living.</li>
<li>Creation is a form of love.</li>
<li>Forgiveness begets negentropy.</li>
<li>Life outcomes are fairly distributed, influenced by both nature and nurture. We can only control the latter.</li>
<li>Some people spawn at more preferable starting points in the game of life. Attempts to artificially alter life consequences with handouts creates resentment and stagnation — two ingredients for a poison with the power to collapse empires.</li>
<li>Most people are not psychologically equipped to realize their potential — but we can help them with that.</li>
<li>Intelligence rarely matters more than hard work and luck. Often, good things happen to those who were at the right place at the right time. Intelligence helps you choose the places you’ll be. Hard work gives you more shots on goal.</li>
<li>Many laws are outdated but are generally good. They should be followed insofar as they are consistent with your internal principals. When laws deviate from your internal principals, you should first question those principles before questioning laws. If you kill someone, there should be consequences for it, even if you have just reasoning. Laws are meant to sustain order and prevent the worst cases, which can sometimes mean punishing trivial ones.</li>
<li>America is still the greatest country on earth because of freedom, but we shouldn’t let that stop us from experiencing the rest of the world.</li>
<li>Poor incentive structures can take freedoms away if we are not careful. No empire is divine.</li>
<li>Drugs get a worse rep than they deserve. It’s remarkable that the ingestion of certain substances can lead to altered states of consciousness, among other miracle effects. We live in a system that incentivizes substance abuse rather than health experimentation.</li>
<li>Hard work is morally good because it lifts up those around you.</li>
<li>You can largely outwork talent, so the playing fields are more level than is often perceived. Most people are unwilling to put in the work.</li>
<li>Saving and investing are morally good behaviors, but spending money is not inherently bad. In many ways, spending all your money is better than saving all of it. You never know when your life will end. You can place your bets far into the future or you can live like you’ll die tomorrow.</li>
<li>Love is more important than having a good career. Nothing is more important than realizing your potential. You’ll know you found the right person when they help you realize yours.</li>
<li>The right position on technology is cautious optimism. All significant changes in society are accompanied by pain. That new technology will leave humans with nothing to do is myopic. It assumes the amount of work to do in the future is finite, when there is no clear upper bounds to knowledge and creativity. We should embrace the future with the spirit of the axiom of choice: no matter the conditions, human creativity finds ways to propagate.</li>
<li>Fulfillment in life can be achieved by focusing on three pillars:<ul>
<li>health: stay healthy. indulge with restraint. eat well. train your body. without health, you are always at a disadvantage. good health — both physically and psychologically — is key to living a good life.</li>
<li>relationships: lovers. family. friends. although many people will come and go in your life, it’s important you contribute significant effort to maintaining relationships. believe everything is forgivable. that time here together is to short to not love each other. yet allow the drifts of life to take its course, and do not let relationships alter the course of your journey. always follow your heart. the best relationships will survive this. it is the test of true love.</li>
<li>work: to obsess over something. to give your life’s energy a purposeful channel. whether building machines, creating art, nurturing children, or tending to nature — doing so with hands or leveraging your mind — your work defines your life’s journey. if you put your energy into it wisely, it can take you to imaginable, profound places. it is the only pillar of life that compounds in exponential ways.</li>

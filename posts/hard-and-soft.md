# hard and soft

what classifies a science as hard or soft comes down to measurement. in physics and chemistry, we use instruments that are high precision and therefore grounded in reality. in psychology we use instruments that are largely ungrounded and can only be useful at scales where the central limit theorem applies. as a result, psychology is much more prone to error — whether in measurement or procedure — and we get things like the replication crisis. but this does not mean psychology is not real science, nor any less science than the “hard” sciences. being a “soft” science generally means that the discipline lacks the measurement precision to accurately ground samples to reality. in the coming years, this will shift dramatically for fields like psychology. advancements in neuro-imaging, among other promising technologies will bring measurement far closer to reality than ever before. it may very well be that psychology becomes the last science, as it ultimately converges with them all — physics, chemistry, biology, sociology are all sides of the same coin: consciousness.

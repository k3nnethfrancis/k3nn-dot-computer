# Rationality illusions and other non-sense

We can and should make decisions — to the greatest degree possible — with sound logic and empiricism. Especially when we consider those decisions of high importance or when they impact the lives of others. But under no circumstances should we come to the belief that humans come close to being perfectly rational beings. Even our most rational arguments are littered with cognitive biases, often self-deluded away. For every good argument you hear, remember there is an equal and oppositely strong argument out there. It is simply a function of your beliefs, morals, loyalties, evidence, and willingness to see it.

While this may be true, we have not yet designed a society that acknowledges it. In fact, when it comes to work, being irrational can be a fireable offense. In most jobs, the expectation is to use logic and reason to solve problems. Job descriptions love using terms like ‘analytical’ and ‘data-driven.’

Empiricism is important after all. To be good at anything, it helps to have a good model of the world. Good models of the world tend to be based on facts. In other words, they make sense when models match reality. But there’s a problem: some aspects of reality are non-sense.

There is a class of solutions to problems that are nonsensical in the traditional sense; defying the normative laws of logic and reasoning.

If you present a solution to a problem at work that follows sound logic and reasoning, your boss will applaud you and, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll get a pat on the back and a “we’ll get ‘em next time.” but rarely will you be fired when everyone agrees with your reasoning. conversely, if you have a ridiculous idea like “let’s run a 'do not buy this jacket' campaign” when your goal is to increase jacket sales, you might be laughed out of the room. not only that, but if you did it anyway and it failed, you’re probably getting fired. 

Yet in 2012 Patagonia did exactly this, resulting in a 30% increase in sales. [^1]

Rory Sutherland is the chairman of [Ogilvy](https://www.ogilvy.com/), one of the most successful marketing agencies in the world, and he calls this psycho-logic. [^2]

Psycho-logic represents a kind of thinking about the world that incorporates a model of human behavior. It often leads to non-conventional thinking and surprisingly effective solutions.

The problem with business is the conventional logic is a fork of economic theories of supply and demand, value, and risk. But human decision making is rarely rational in the ways economic models posit. The decisions humans make are rational insofar as they are aligned with their internal beliefs, but they often defy conventional logic pushed by economists.

In fact, some of the world's most innovative ideas were originally seen as insane. But they worked. The telephone, automobile, radio, computers, and the internet are all examples of technologies that were initially ridiculed but later came to revolutionize society.

The problem in business is the incentives often designed so people act risk averse rather than risk seeking. Bad decisions get punished when they do not align with conventional wisdom, leaving almost no room for innovation. This only gets worse as businesses become calcified in their bureaucracy.

The difference between nonsense and non-sense is that one of these things is truly illogical and the other only seems so based on conventional wisdom. The idea of psycho-logic is that we break the conventional wisdom of the economists and begin looking at the world from the lens of a psychoanalyst.

This way of thinking is inherently risky because it requires you to think differently than everyone else.

The problem with conventional economic models and risk averse thinking is that it operates under the normative model of human reasoning — that is, everyone else is thinking the same way as you. But if you want to stand out in the world or be innovative in your business strategy you must think differently. You cannot follow the same logical process as any other human or else wind up in the same places as them with the same boring ideas that don’t work.

The kind of thinking we need more of in the world is the opposite — the non-normative, non-sensical thinking, where trying new things, no matter how wild they may seem, is permitted — because we often have the reasoning process backwards. We like to first think of the reasoning then think of the solution. If we want to be innovators, we should stop trying to reason about problems, and just try new things, regardless of how irrational they may seem. If you look at the history of science, you'll find that most breakthroughs have come from this kind of thinking. It was only after the fact that science and logic had a place in the procedure of explaining the the hell just happened.

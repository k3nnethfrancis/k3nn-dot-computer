# 3 pillars of life

there are 3 pillars of life. the state of these things is what determines your level of fulfillment.
    - health: stay healthy. indulge with restraint. eat well. train your body. without health, you are always at a disadvantage. good health — both physically and psychologically — is key to living a good life.
    - relationships: lovers. family. friends. although many people will come and go in your life, it’s important you contribute significant effort to maintaining relationships. believe everything is forgivable. that time here together is to short to not love each other. yet allow the drifts of life to take its course, and do not let relationships alter the course of your journey. always follow your heart. the best relationships will survive this. it is the test of true love.
    - work: to obsess over something. to give your life’s energy a purposeful channel. whether building machines, creating art, nurturing children, or tending to nature — doing so with hands or leveraging your mind — your work defines your life’s journey. if you put your energy into it wisely, it can take you to imaginable, profound places. it is the only pillar of life that compounds in exponential ways.

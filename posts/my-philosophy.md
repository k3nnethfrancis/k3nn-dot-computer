# life philosophy

the following principles for life are both guiding and aspirational. it is difficult to keep them in mind at all times. i would be surprised to meet anyone who has never strayed from their own personal philosophy. we should simply accept when this happens and correct it for the future.

1. there are no defined paths, only routes for which others have shown can lead to a destination
2. kindness is an important virtue but some will confuse it for weakness. use that to your advantage
3. money is a number in a database. use it as leverage, not a barrier.
4. love makes life worth living
5. creation is a form of love
6. forgiveness begets negentropy
7. life is an entropic spline where minimas are solace maximas are depression
8. altercations to the body and mind should be done wisely but without fear

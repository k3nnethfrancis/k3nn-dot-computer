# on investing

we shouldnâ€™t overcomplicate investing, but we should be consciously aware of when we walk the line of the gambler. 

for 99% of people, futures trading is gambling. for 99% of coins, crypto trading is gambling. for 99% of early stage startups, angel investments are gambling.

if you are going to gamble, make sure you are in one of two positions: nothing to lose or enough cushion to catch your fall.

when these apply to you, a little bit of gambling can be good. in fact, the more successful you are at making money, the more you should gamble it. calculated risks are still risks, but outsized returns can create exponential outcomes.

the real fight is resisting FOMO. it takes great discipline to overcome our emotional ties to money. if you walk the gamblers line without your wits about you, do not be surprised when you get burned.

# rationality illusions

we can and should make decisions—to the greatest degree possible—with sound logic and empiricism. especially when we consider those decisions of high importance or when they impact the lives of others. but under no circumstances should we come to the belief that humans even come close to being perfectly rational beings. even our most rational arguments are littered with cognitive biases that we cannot see. indeed that’s why we call them biases. for every good argument you hear, remember there is an equal and oppositely strong argument out there. it is simply a function of your beliefs, morals, loyalties, evidence, and willingness to see it.

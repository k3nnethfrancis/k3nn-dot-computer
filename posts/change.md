# change is constant

change is not fixed. it is constant. this is true all the way from the atomic level unto the level of the universe. so why then, do you tell yourself you want to change, but expect that this should happen overnight? change is a process â€” a continuous reprogramming of the simulation. the experience begins at the level of thought and then through to behavior. as a man thinketh, he become. preserve your attention. feel the process. aim high. 

you have the power to tune your algorithm.

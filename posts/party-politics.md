# meditations on party politics

the operational efficiencies of democracy seem to be in their infancy, despite a couple hundred years of work. while a two party system is probably the worst version of this,  it surprises me that any democracy can function at all, let alone be the most successful form of government in terms of average GDP. 

the multidimensional nature of belief simply cannot be expressed via anything short of an infinite spectrum of ideology where we can, at best, form clusters of beliefs that are close enough together such that we can at least all vote for the same person, or at least bucket ourselves into a set of them. 

it seems to me that democracy and the two party system have been at nash equilibrium for some time, which explains why nothing ever changes. 

history tends to be written by the victor in the form of a heroes journey. “it was george washington who led the american army to victory!” and “it was abe lincoln who freed the slaves!” — when in fact it was just the right person in the right place at the right time. 

the same is true for political parties. it’s not that they represent the will of the people, but rather that they are the will of the people. the two party system is a reflection of the two largest buckets of people, and the fact that most people don’t vote for third party candidates is because they don’t want to be the “spoiler” that “helps” the other side win.

it’s a neat trick, really. the same way that the stock market is a reflection of the sum of all the knowledge of all the participants, the two party system is a reflection of the sum of all the beliefs of all the voters. it’s just a shame that it’s so one-dimensional.
